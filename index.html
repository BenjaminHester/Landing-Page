        <h3 id="history">A little about us</h3>
            <p>Established in '84, the Barry-Bean-Farm was always about keeping people happy. Though the few years prior to our creation were bleak, we made it our mission to bring back the great times and happiness of old. We started small, a home business, where anyone could walk in the door and buy a simple cup of coffee and have grown into a multi billion dollar business with over 400 recipes! </p>
        <h3 id="brothers">Our Founders</h3>
            <p>Matthew and Jeremiah Barrow created Barry's Happy Coffee Bean Farm in memory of their father and grandfather.</p>
            <p>Their father, John Barrow, raised them on the same farm re-bought by Barry and taught them the art that is making and selling coffee. John created the early form of BHCBF<i class="fa-solid fa-copyright"></i> by the name of Barrow Family Farms.<i class="fa-solid fa-copyright"></i> John was unfortunately drafted into the latest Great War in 1981 and later died in service at the age of 55. He made his last wish for his sons to take over the family business and rename it after his father, their grandfather, Barry.</p>
            <p>Their grandfather, Barry Barrow, bought the farm in 1935 before selling 5 years later and re-buying not even a year later in 1941.  </p>
